# Installing and running Good Nomen

This repository provides scripts for executing Good Nomen within a Docker container. First, you will need to install the Docker engine (see [https://docs.docker.com/install](https://docs.docker.com/install/)). Then execute the `build_docker` script at the command line to build the Good Nomen Docker image (this may need to be modified slightly on Windows). After the image has been built, use the `run_docker` script to start a container with Good Nomen running inside it.
